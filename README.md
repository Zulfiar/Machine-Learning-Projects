# Data Structures and Algorithm in Python
This Repo is used for the implementation of data structures and algorithms and practices common programming technical interview questions. Python is used for these tasks but
any language can be used. why did I choose python? Because python is easy to code/read, if I have to use some pointers then  I will use C/C++. Many non-High-Performance-computing tasks can be implemented using python. Using C/C++ for high-performance tasks does make sense since it is more close to the hardware (precompiled and better performance, memory efficiency).
